/*
***Notes to self for tommorow***
-make cnc plane a cartesian plane. 
-set bottom left as origin
-select shape, parameters for shape are center point and other stuff depending on shape(radius, side length, etc)
    - for a line other info will be needed since only center wont fork for position
-using shape parameters "plot" points of verticies on cnc cartesian plane
- if a point is out of plane throw an error
- start with circle, then try triangle
- prpbably use array for dimensions on plane and shape information
